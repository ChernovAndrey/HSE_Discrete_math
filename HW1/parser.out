Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> statement
Rule 1     statement -> expression
Rule 2     expression -> expression CONJUCTION expression
Rule 3     expression -> expression DISJUCTION expression

Terminals, with rules where they appear

CONJUCTION           : 2
DISJUCTION           : 3
IMPLICATION          : 4
LPAREN               : 5
RPAREN               : 5
VARIABLE             : 6
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

expression           : 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5
statement            : 0
